# Multichannel-Light-Sensor
Light Sensor Prototype for Surrey Sleep Research Centre (SSRC)

The aim of this project is to develop a fully functional sensor that measures the intensity of light at different wavelengths within the visible spectrum. A mobile application then retrieves the data from the sensor, storing it both locally and in a database within a secure server. The sensor will be used as a proof of concept to develop a commercial product that will be used to perform studies at the Surrey Sleep Research Centre (SSRC) aimed at analysing the influence of light on human overall health and sleep quality.

A full description of the project can be found on the report. The code is not publicly available so if you want to learn more send me a message.
